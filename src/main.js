We utilized the process of developing this game as a way to cope with the difficult time 
we are living in. We created all of our own assets, and we produced all of the music within
the game. We implemented an area above the endless runner, with the intention to have the player 
be able to just relax in the clouds & enjoy the music while the game still continued. The player 
could collect points or take a break a vibe in the world we created.

Thank you.
